 * This handles file uploads for the Sdm Media Display app and provides some basic security. It
 * is based on code found in the manual pages at @see http://php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php.
 *
 * This script security is designed with the understanding that by the time this script is run
 * the file has already been uploaded, so rather then prevention, it checks the uploaded file
 * and removes it if security issues are found.
 *
 * For example:
 * The mime type is usually checked in $FILE, which is not secure since it's values can be tampered with,
 * so this script checks the uploaded files type with PHP's finfo() class.
