# SDM_CMS
A unique json driven CMS that comes packed with a solid API, and some cool
technologies such as jQuery and jQuery UI. It's theme-able and can be
extended by user developed apps. Comes with a UI for content management,
however if you don't like the UI provided you can create your own UI by
creating your own Content Management app. The SDM CMS will eventually
be Database compatible as well, and switching from JSON mode to a
DATABASE of your choice will all be done via the UI, but for now JSON
is enough.

The SDM CMS is working well enough to build sites with but is still lacking
some major components including Security, Users, and optimized code.

Still very much in development, the SDM CMS is going to be and incredibly stable,
functional, and very simple to use CMS that will make building websites
more fun from a design perspective, and easier for developers to use from
a coding perspective. The goal is that even totally non tech savy users
will be able to download it and build websites without writing a line of code,
and sitll at the same time be completly hackable by users who want to get
more out of the SDM CMS.
